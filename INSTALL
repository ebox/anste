ANSTE Installation
------------------
To install ANSTE simply do make install.

Then copy the provided configuration file conf/anste.conf to
/etc/anste and change it until it suits your needs.
(do the same for anste-manager.conf if you want to use anste-manager)

If you want to install only anste, anste-manager or anste-job
there are also rules in the Makefile for each one:

make install-anste
make install-anste-manager
make install-anste-job

For Debian users there are packages available in the following repository:

deb http://www.ebox-platform.com/debian/anste/ unstable/

Add the line above to your /etc/apt/sources.list, then apt-get update
and apt-get install anste anste-manager anste-job

You can also build your own packages with the provided debian/rules script.

Xen configuration
-----------------
For the correct working of ANSTE with Xen you have to edit
your /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp and uncomment the following lines:

(network-script network-nat)
(vif-script     vif-nat)

Ensure that the lines containing network-bridge, network-route
and vif-bridge, vif-route are commented.


Note for anste-manager users:
-----------------------------
If you are going to use anste-manager is very recommendable to have
HTTP and SMTP servers running on the machine. You can configure the path 
where the results should be stored in anste-manager.conf. It's also
a good idea to have a working FTP or SSH server to let the users upload
the tests that are going to run.
