To install ANSTE simply do make install.

Then copy the provided configuration file conf/anste.conf to
/etc/anste and change it until it suits your needs.
(do the same for anste-manager.conf if you want to use anste-manager)

If you want to install only anste, anste-manager or anste-job
there are also rules in the Makefile for each one:

make install-anste
make install-anste-manager
make install-anste-job

Soon will be Debian packages available in a repository, but you
can build your own ones with the provided debian/rules script.
