Manage XML parse errors (validating??).
Add routing to the network description.
Add exceptions everywhere!!
The virtualized system must install libsoap-lite-perl and so on...
To improve the security on remote executed commands limit the path could be
an option.

Remove all the barewords related with IO, and all the shifts for parameters
Change all the non-interpolating literals with ' '
Review the file reading, <FILE> vs read, line by line instead of all, etc...

Check errors on all IO functions.

Package a deb with ansted and anste-slave 

Manage errors in System::Commands with exceptions and umount when a fail
occurs.

Not all machines need ebox to be installed, so it will be convenient
to have different baseimages
Provide only two type of images that will be created with CreateBaseImage:
baseimage and ebox-baseimage

Rewrite get/put to send attachments with MIME:
examples -> http://bioinfo.montp.cnrs.fr/doc/phpMan.php/man/SOAP::Lite

Probably change to expat instead of libxml-dom-perl.


Global configuration file??: Default path for the data, xen-tools.conf
autogenerated, specifying size of the images?, etc.

Xen-tools.conf must be created dynamically based on configuration file and
command line parameters given to CreateBaseImage


Before executing anste-slave finished iptables rules must be cleaned.


When doing all in a generic way could be interesting to have pre and post
scripts (directory.d), etc.


Unit tests!!!!! (mainly for SlaveClient->MasterServer)


Test with vmware and windows to assure system and virtualizer independence??


Package .debs!!! (add 'debian' directory on svn too)


Add README, INSTALL, ...
