#  Installation method.
#
#  There are four distinct methods which you may to install a new copy
# of Linux to use in your Xen guest domain:
#
#   - Installation via the debootstrap command.
#   - Installation via the rpmstrap command.
#   - Installation by copying a directory containing a previous installation.
#   - Installation by untarring a previously archived image.
#
#  NOTE That if you use the "untar", or "copy" options you should ensure
# that the image you're left with matches the 'dist' setting later in
# this file.
